# Release Notes v0.5.5

## Introduction

This is a bugfix to 0.5.4 which is a **major** release, there have been significant changes from 0.4.0 so it is important to read [v0.5.4 Release Notes](rn051.md) in its entirety if you have are familiar with previous versions

# Summary

**BUGS FIXED**

* UPNP devices not appearing / not discoverable by Alexa: new ucom.txt file in SPIFFS - re-upload SPIFFS
* Exception using certain functions in onMQTTConnect / Disconnect: Caused by event functions being called in sys context and not from queue, AsyncMQTT updated to put onConnect/Disconnect in queue
* H4P_Timekeeper: would cause repeated random timeouts in MQTT connection. 
* Name precedence was not not working correctly in H4P_Wifi / H4P_UPNPServer

**NEW**

* GPIO Strategy AnalogAverage + [Example Sketch](../examples/H4GM_AnalogAverage/H4GM_AnalogAverage.ino)
* [NTP Clock sketch on Wemos D1 Mini OLED shield](../examples/H4P_OLED_NTP_CLOCK/H4P_OLED_NTP_CLOCK.ino)

**CHANGED**

* Error code H4_CMD_NOT_NOW returned from `at` / `daily` in [H4P_Timekeeper](h4tk.md) if NTP not yet sync'd
* [H4P_CmdErrors](h4ce.md) ameneded fro new code translation "Can't do now"

## AsyncWebServer Authenticaton removed

[H4P_AsyncWebServer](h4asws.md) no longer provides admin username/password, hence they are removed from its constructor. 

It's a long story, and not a happy one.

## Mandatory starting requirements

The standard opening of any H4 sketch has changed considerably. First the mandatory call to H4 has been moved into `H4_USE_PLUGINS` so it is no longer required. Also, a decision was made to incorporate [H4P_SerialCmd](h4cmd.md) into *all* sketches automatically, so this has also been moved into `H4_USE_PLUGINS` which now performs all mandatory sketch initialisation in a single line.

This means that the parameters to H4 *and* H4P_SerialCmd are now passed instead to `H4_USE_PLUGINS`. A typical sketch now starts:

```cpp
#include<H4Plugins.h>
H4_USE_PLUGINS(115200,20,false) // Serial baud rate, Q size, SerialCmd autostop
```

The parameters are:

* Serial baud rate. If No Serial output is required, use 0
* Queue size. There is little reason to change this from the default value of 20, and only expert users should change this.
* New is the "`autoStop`" feature of H4P_SerialCmd

Stopping the `scmd` service improves performance by up to 50% (400% on STM32-NUCLEO!) so should be considered for all production code. The downside is that you are no longer able to issue Serial console commands. This can be reversed by remote restart of the scmd service (e.g. MQTT, HTTP REST, the new Web Console).

The default is false for development and testing, i.e do NOT auto-stop the `scmd` service (and therefore *do* allow Serial console commands) at the expense of overall performance.

Finally, the "handle" to the SerialCmd service has been changed from `h4sc` to `h4cmd` bit its service name remains the same at `scmd`

## *All* Plugins as services

Previously, some plugins such as WiFi and MQTT ran as "services" meaning they could be started and stopped and otherwise controlled in a standard manner. This has been extended to *all* plugins so that there is now a standard interface for everything and far fewer individual commands.

This means you *must* read the section on [command handling](h4cmd.md) before digging deeper into v0.5.4

## Things and switches input connectors are now "Sources"

The naming of the input connectors to drive Things or switches was confusing and they have now been changed to end in "Source". Any plugin ending this way will automatically link to either an `H4P_BinarySwitch` or `H4P_BinaryThing`. Also, the final parameter of all the GPIO-linked calls has been removed, as they each connect automatically to the default output device which must remain as `h4onof`.

Additionally, there is now an "autoOff" parameter on both `H4P_BinarySwitch` and `H4P_BinaryThing` meaning that they will turn themselves off after a given amount of time, irrespective of which source commanded them on. If left at the default valueof 0 they will stay one until commanded off.

The UPNP variants of Switch and Thing have been removed and replaced by a single `H4P_UPNPServer` which acts as a source in the same way as the GPIO input connectors.

In summary, a sketch may now have only a `H4P_BinarySwitch` **OR** a `H4P_BinaryThing` as its default action. This can be driven by any of the following input sources:

* GPIO-Related:

    * AnalogThresholdSource
    * DebouncedSource
    * EncoderSource
    * LatchingSource
    * PolledSource
    * RawSource
    * RetriggeringSource
    * MultiFunctionButton
  
* Time-related
    * atSource
    * dailySource

* Network-related

    * MQTT commands on/off/toggle/switch
    * HTTP REST requests on/off/toggle/switch
    * Web console
    * Presence detection of:
        * IP Address
        * H4 Device
        * UPNP USN identifier
        * MDNS service/protocol

* Serial console commands
* Physical button/switch

## AP Mode

A decision was taken to remove any automatic start into AP Mode, as used to happen after a factory reset.

The rationale is that H4/Plugins is a programming framework, not a "drop-in" replacement, so you will always be starting from the point of compiling your ssid and password into your code.

There is still the ability to force AP mode (for whatever reason) using the [H4P_MultifunctionButton](h4mfnb.md). This was previously the H4P_ThreeFunctionButton and would initiate a factory reset after beinf held for more than 5 seconds.

The [H4P_MultifunctionButton](h4mfnb.md) is now a *four*-function button. If held for more than 10 seconds it will force a reboot into AP mode. You can acheive the same effect with the new command `h4/wifi/apmode`.


If you get stuck you can revert your device to STA mode with  the `h4/wifi/change/newssid,newpassword` command to change the ssid "on the fly".

Given these options, it was felt that there was no strong reason for ever booting into AP mode automatically.

---

## Renamed commands

* `h4/mqtt/change` (change MQTT server:port) is now `h4/mqtt`

* `h4/upnp/name` (change UPNP device friendly name) is now `h4/upnp`

---

## MQTT library changed

H4/Plugins now use the [MQTT Async Client library]() in place of `PubSubClient`. You must donwload and install the Async lib before compiling any v0.5.4 programs

---

# REMOVED

## Unloading

All refernces, functions, commands related to unloading plugins have been removed, as the same functionality is now provided by the `h4/svc/stop/xxxx` [command](h4cmd.md)

## Trusted names

All refernces, functions, commands related to "trusted names" have been removed, as the same functionality is now provided by service names an the human-readable values for these is now available in the [new functions](#functions) `h4ce.getTaskType` and `h4ce.getTaskName`
