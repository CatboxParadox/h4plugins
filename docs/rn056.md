# Release Notes v0.5.6

## Introduction

Includes minor bugfixes and some new features.The main change is that the web UI now features dynamic filedds and allows useres to easily add their own.

There are no breaking changes, but you will need to reupload SPIFFS (now @ 0.5.6) on any sketch using [H4P_AsyncWebServer](h4asws.md)

# Summary

**BUGS FIXED**

* AP mode not getting cleared on factory reset with ESP32 target. (Now also gets cleared on `h4/svc/wifi/clear` on all targets)

---

**Known Issues**

Dynamic web update (new feature, see below) may appear "dead" / unresponsive occasionally. Workaround is to refresh browser. This is believed to be a problem in the underlying libraries / core and is still being investigated.

Web UI does not "line up" in Firefox browser - expect fix in next minor release (any CSS / HTML expert help is welcomed!)
