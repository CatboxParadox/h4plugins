2020/02/11  0.2.0
1   SPIFFS functions moved to SerialCmd from WiFi
2   h4sc.logEvent added
3   added new plugins LocalLogger and SerialLogger 
4   various other code changes to support logging
5   introduce mandatory requirement to follow H4Plugins.h with H4_USE_PLUGINS
    to banish forever the "initialisation hell" that is cause by different static
    initalisation in differetn compilers. Its hottible, but it works and it easier
    than a ground-up rewrite
