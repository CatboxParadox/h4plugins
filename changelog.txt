    breaking changes
        dumpQ / trustednames fully decoupled from H4 - requires upgrade to H4/0.5.0
        (dumpQ + many others now compile-outable)
        H4P_AsyncMQTT replaces H4P_MQTT: pubsubclient removed, fixing 5-sec lockout delay on reconnect "feature"
            you will need to download the new library
        UPNP Switch / Source removed: replaced by free-standing UPNPServer
        All xSource GPIO connectors no longer have BinarySource* as final parameter, they are automatically bound to h4onof
    new
        Presence detection
            IP
            IPSource
            USN
            USNSource
        Service management cmds: h4/svc/{start|stop|restart}/XXXX
        h4/show/heap
        H4P_CmdErrors
            new getTaskType / getTaskName to blend with new decoupled dumpQ
    changed
        Huge code refactor / tidy / optimise (sonoff example now 445152) / Free Heap increased
            ALL plugins now operate as services, new svc control commands common to all
        much "show" type functionality moved into #ifdef H4P_LOG_EVENTS optional compilation blocks
    deleted
        many service start/restart/stop cmds, replaced by: Service management cmds
        unload concept disappears: h4/svc/stop now unhooks what used to be unloadable
        trustednames concept disappears, see new getTaskType / getTaskName
2020/02/19  0.4.0
    fixed
        OTA on ESP32
        onChange bug in persistent storage
    new

    changed
    getConfig moved from service to plugin - no accessible form SerialCmd
        error removed from dealut log msg
        new H4P_LOG_ERROR with seperate log msg id res > 0

    breaking changes:
        h4/factory moved to serialcmd from wifi // update docs!
    changed

2020/02/18  0.3.4
    breaking changes:
    1. _hasName removed from H4: MUST upgrade to 0.4.1
    2. BasicSwitch renamed to BinarySwitch
    new
    1. Logging
        filtering added to exisiting loggers
        added loggers:
            H4P_MQTTLogger
            H4P_MQTTHeapLogger
    2. Source/Switch paradigm
        BasicSwitch renamed to BinarySwitch
        added   BinarySource
                UPNPSource
        GPIOManager heavily modified
            added   DebouncedSource

2020/02/12  0.2.1
    patch - put back in ip display on got ip
    move AP mode ssid lists delete to STA got IP
2020/02/11  0.2.0
1   SPIFFS functions moved to SerialCmd from WiFi
2   h4sc.logEvent added
3   added new plugins LocalLogger and SerialLogger 
4   various other code changes to support logging
5   introduce mandatory requirement to follow H4Plugins.h with H4_USE_PLUGINS
    to banish forever the "initialisation hell" that is cause by different static
    initialisation in different compilers. Its horrible, but it works and it's easier
    than a ground-up rewrite :)

TODO:
SOONER
    FR chain: add removerService mdns H4
    no auto AP mode if ssid / psk extant
    3fb -> FOUR fb
SHORTTERM
    state MQTT bcast to all, add obey[h4] cmd
    coalesce wifif scan 8266/32
    event on PS changed
    centrlaise / globalise onof?
MEDIUMTERM
    decent tabulated gpio pin dump
    MDNS/local domain detector
LONGTERM
    ethernet module stm32
    ESP32 bluetooth PD
    remote client get
    rf bridge
    signal on no spiffs
    fix switch.ps1 to use soap etc (revert a la esparto)
    lots of const string&
